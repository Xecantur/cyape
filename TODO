						CYAPE's TODO list

Cyape will implement the following features in version 1.0 later versioning will follow the following scheme

1.x-1.9

1.5 is not Master 1.5 it the Final_Write Branch moniker, Master 1.5 will be marked 1.5.0 

bug fixes may go 1.subversion.1 - 5 (ie 1.0.5 then it would roll over to 1.1) 

1.0 Features are the Same as below but since Final_Write is the Working branch for all intents an purposes Final_Write is Master for the time being until its merged into 1.0 functionality

Features for 1.5:
[ ] implement level format using JSON(libjansson)
[X!] implement texture (including TTF ) loading 
	!- ("animated" sprites not supported yet);
[X] implement audio loading and playing pausing was added via SDL_Mixer
[ ] implement phsyics via chipmunk (might still do custom)
[ ] implement some form of scriptable ai preferably in python
[ ] implement rudimentary network code ( ie able to send and recieve library structures )
[!] implement a menu interface for creating menu's and sub-menu's really just GUI stuff in general like buttons
	!- ("Buttons and Callbacks implemented in 1.5(Final_Write) ")
[ ] implement save format with JSON
[ ] implement input handling via SDL_PollEvent though try to abstract it to avoid relying soley on it
[ ] beginnings of an in binary level editor
[ ] implement common place mechanics like stats tracking ie highscore number of deaths

Features for 2.0
[ ] Actual AI 1.0's ai is likely to be pretty stupid so reimplement this
[ ] clean up code base and optimize where possible
[ ] if at all possible implement different types of AI (simple, smart, mediocre, enemy, friendly)
==TBC==
